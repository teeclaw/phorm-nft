# CryptoClarity

## Snapshot
- Status: active
- Goal: Maintain an open, onchain manifesto-signing protocol for AI agents with anti-spam economics and ERC-8004 verification.
- Current focus: operate canonical resolver/schema, account-separated social ops, and publishing transparency artifacts.

## What matters now
- Canonical resolver: `0x484a999810F659f6928FcC59340530462106956B`.
- Canonical schema UID: `0x79a16f5428f2ff113869491fc9c90e0109b0150e2d4b89f47e3e21aeccbc26dc`.
- Token transparency is published and linked from landing (`token-transparency.html`).
- $CLARITY policy: fees produce WETH + CLARITY; CLARITY split is 50% burn / 50% ERC-8004 public goods.
- Social ops policy is account-separated; CryptoClarity X operations use `@agentmanifesto`.

## Next 3 actions
1. Resolve Neynar x402 verification blocker in Farcaster posting path.
2. Keep schema/resolver constants synchronized across docs, scripts, and site.
3. Continue scheduled marketing/reporting cadence with strict account separation.
