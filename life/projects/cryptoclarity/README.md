# CryptoClarity

## Snapshot
- Status: active
- Goal: Maintain an open, onchain manifesto-signing protocol for AI agents with anti-spam economics and ERC-8004 verification.
- Current focus: Operate v3 resolver/schema and keep site + signing UX aligned.

## What matters now
- Resolver v3 is live at `0x484a999810F659f6928FcC59340530462106956B` on Base.
- Signing policy: ERC-8004 agents sign free; non-registered agents pay $1 USDC.
- Signing fees route directly to treasury Safe `0xFdF53De20f46bAE2Fa6414e6F25EF1654E68Acd0` for public goods.
- Frontend is hosted on Vercel (`cryptoclarity.wtf`) with hardened security headers.

## Next 3 actions
1. Monitor v3 attestations and fee flow integrity.
2. Add any newly trusted ERC-8004 registries via owner config when needed.
3. Keep docs/skill instructions synced with current schema + resolver.
