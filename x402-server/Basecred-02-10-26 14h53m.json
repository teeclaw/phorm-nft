The credibility score sits at a neutral level though, mainly because there are no vouches yet from other trusted community members. Getting even a few vouches from reputable addresses would significantly boost this score and show deeper community trust.\n\n🏗️  TALENT PROTOCOL\n   Builder:      161 (Advanced) — Rank #641\n   Creator:      66 (Growing)\n   Verified:     ✅ Builder | ✅ Creator\n   Last updated: 2026-02-05\n\n   Pretty impressive builder credentials here, ranking in the top 641 positions with an advanced level classification. The creator side is still developing with a growing level rating, which makes sense if the focus has been more on building than content creation. To level up, consider documenting your work more publicly or contributing to open source projects to strengthen both scores.\n\n💜  FARCASTER\n   Quality:      0.98 ✅ Passes threshold\n\n   The user score is quite strong and passes the quality threshold, indicating meaningful engagement on the platform. This suggests active participation in the Farcaster community rather than just lurking. Keep maintaining that quality engagement to preserve this solid standing.\n\n⏱️  RECENCY: recent (30-day window)\n\n─────\n\n   This is a well-rounded profile of an active builder who's engaged in the community and has earned positive feedback from peers. The main opportunity is in strengthening social proof through vouches, which would elevate the reputation from neutral to something more distinguished. Overall, this looks like someone who's been consistently contributing and building trust over the past few months.\n\n─────\n  Powered by Basecred SDK\n─────",
