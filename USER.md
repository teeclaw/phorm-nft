# USER.md - About Your Human

_Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go._

- **Name:** 0xdas
- **What to call them:** 0xd
- **Pronouns:** 
- **Timezone:** GMT+7 (Western Indonesia/Thailand time)
- **Notes:** Prefers interacting via Telegram. This Telegram channel is dedicated only to social media posting work, and replies should only be sent in the Telegram topic "Social". Currently building Invisible Law (Fully Onchain NFT) - Geoplet. Communication preference: give direct recommendations and next actions, avoid asking "what do you want" when decisive guidance is possible. Strict instruction: do not use "if you want" phrasing; always recommend the concrete next step directly. Execution preference: proceed autonomously on project tasks without waiting for explicit per-step permission. Repo workflow preference: do not commit/push on every small step; batch changes and push at logical milestones. Engineering principle: follow KISS; keep solutions simple in architecture and operations, while preserving strong security controls (simple != less secure). For CryptoClarity ops: treat X account @agentmanifesto as Premium; separate account ops strictly between @0xdasx, @mr_crtee, and @agentmanifesto. **CRITICAL GIT RULE:** Agent Royale repo is `teeclaw/agent-royale-v2.git` ONLY. The old `teeclaw/agent-royale.git` repo must NEVER be used. Always verify `git remote -v` shows `agent-royale-v2` before any push. Formatting preference: blank line between paragraphs (line spacing), proper sentence case.

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
