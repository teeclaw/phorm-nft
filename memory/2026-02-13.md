- **Previous registration:** Expired (claim_id `88e8c0a5...`), credentials deleted
- **New registration:**
  - Agent name: `Mr_Tee`
  - Claim ID: `f0c9ff4c0de640ccb0da4e743f51e122457b8c7f4334e51662e099cfbe868192`

- **Status:** VERIFIED ✅ (0xd verified via X tweet)

### Reputation Checks Performed

**1. Owner wallet `0x1348...7e41` — check-owner (no proof first, then with proof)**
- All 5 contexts: DENY
- First run (no proof): LOW confidence — data coverage problem
- Second run (with ZK proof): HIGH confidence, 4/5 submitted on-chain
  - Allowlist: `0x59666afa...` ✅
  - Apply: `0xe871d9dd...` ✅
  - Comment: ❌ nonce error (server-side)
  - Publish: `0x63b849bb...` ✅
  - Governance: `0x2e085965...` ✅
- Issue: Neutral trust, Explorer-level builder/creator. Low signal coverage on this wallet.

**2. Owner wallet `0x168d...18ed` — decide-with-proof + submit**
- Context: allowlist.general → DENY
- But: 100% signal coverage, Very High social trust, Very Low spam risk
- Builder level: BUILDER (better than 0x1348)
- On-chain tx: `0x0a2d3c23...` ✅
- DENY due to policy requirements for on-chain trust + creator credentials

### Key Findings & Feedback for 0xd (Basecred Dev)

1. **SKILL.md doesn't force end-to-end on-chain** — agent can opt out with `withProof=false` or skip `/agent/submit`. No mandatory language.
2. **`/api/v1/agent/feed` endpoint is undocumented** — dashboard polls it but SKILL.md doesn't mention it
3. **Feed shows all entries as "off-chain"** even when API returned `onChain.submitted: true` with txHashes — likely a bug
4. **Feed only recorded first `check-owner` call** — second call (with proofs) and `decide-with-proof`+`submit` not visible
5. **`/agent/submit` logged as `---` (no status)** in Vercel logs despite returning 200 with txHash
6. **Nonce collision** on comment context during `check-owner` with proofs (server submitting multiple txs too fast)

### Suggestions Given to 0xd
- Remove `withProof=false` option or make language mandatory ("MUST NOT skip proofs")
- Document `/agent/feed` in SKILL.md
- Include decision, txHash, onChainStatus in feed entries
- Include third-party checks in feed, not just owner checks
- Add subject field to feed entries
- Consider server-side auto-submit on `/decide-with-proof` to prevent agents skipping

## Key Change from Previous basecred Setup
- Old skill: local `openclaw-basecred-sdk` (scripts/check-reputation.mjs using Ethos/Talent/Farcaster APIs directly)
- New skill: hosted zkBaseCred API (zkbasecred.xyz) with ZK proofs + on-chain submission
- Both can coexist — different approaches to reputation checking

## Molthub Blocker
- No `MOLTHUB_API_KEY` in `~/.openclaw/.env` — only `MOLTBOOK_*` keys exist
- Molthub heartbeat can't complete without credentials
- Need to either add the key or remove Molthub from HEARTBEAT.md

## Model
- Session switched to moonshot/kimi-k2.5 by user during this session
