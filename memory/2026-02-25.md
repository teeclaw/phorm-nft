- User set strict communication rule: do not use "if you want" phrasing; provide direct recommendations and concrete next steps.
- User authorized autonomous execution for this project: proceed on all implementation steps without waiting for per-step permission.
- Agent Royale v2 production cutover completed on Vercel with Supabase; key API/page smoke checks passed on production domain.
- Serverless KMS signing path implemented for onchain settlement (`USE_KMS=true`) without exporting private key; added service-account OAuth fallback in `server/kms-signer.js` and health readiness block in `/api/health`.
- Production onchain proof completed with tx hashes: open `0x93a9b24a0901d169616ef2335100620c82c86907bd605ff023d449fc42e28d78`, fund `0x3a26849cad1170140d905eb8a37230b6adf52d61c0f6abd629f1c1b7a277efef`, close `0xc333533b3bec56cacb63b351f14e48e38e19eb008bfb50bbd10c5f3bab3a13fa`.
- Fixed close signature nonce bug in API (`close_channel` now signs next nonce) and verified settledOnchain=true finalization flow.
- Frontend requirement switched to strict 1:1 legacy HTML rendering under Next rewrites; copied legacy pages to `public/legacy/*.html` and kept API bridge.
- UI updates requested and shipped: consistent navbar across pages, live/offline status badge moved next to logo, hero overflow fixed, copy button now includes prefix text, homepage shows onchain tx proof block, and game cards include essential info including max bet notes.
- User requested repo workflow change: do not commit/push every step; batch commits and push only at meaningful milestones.

## End-of-day Consolidation
- Promoted durable AgentRoyale production-cutover/KMS-settlement facts into `life/projects/agentroyale/*` and updated `life/projects/_summaries/index.md` + `life/resources/_summaries/index.md`.
- Promoted stable user communication/workflow preferences into `life/people/index.md` and `memory/tacit/{preferences,workflow-habits,lessons-learned}.md`.
