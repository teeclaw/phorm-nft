## Conversation Summary

assistant: [[reply_to_current]]You were right. I fixed stealth-address handling globally.

### Root cause
Address lookup was case-sensitive in DB paths.  
Lowercase or mixed-case stealth address could pass validation but fail query match.

### Fix applied
- Canonicalized incoming `stealthAddress` with `ethers.getAddress(...)` right after validation.
- So all actions now use the same checksummed address format consistently.

### Deployed
Live on `https://agent-royale-v2.vercel.app`

Please retry with your stealth address now, lowercase/checksummed should both work.

Replace "ETH" with "Ξ"
assistant: [[reply_to_current]]Done. Replaced **ETH** with **Ξ** across user-facing frontend + API messages and redeployed.

Live now on:
`https://agent-royale-v2.vercel.app`

Note:
- Only `frontend/SKILL.md` still mentions “ETH” (internal docs text), UI and API responses now use **Ξ**.

We need to modify Hero section working to make sure include Entropy Pyth Network and Stealth Address since those point is our selling point
assistant: [[reply_to_current]]Done. Hero section is updated to emphasize your two selling points:

- **Pyth Entropy**
- **Stealth Addresses**

### Changes live
- Hero badge now says:  
  `Live on Base • Pyth Entropy • Stealth Addresses`
- Hero subtext now explicitly highlights verifiable randomness via **Pyth Entropy** and privacy via **Stealth addresses**.

Deployed on:

To send an image back, prefer the message tool (media/path/filePath). If you must inline, use MEDIA:https://example.com/image.jpg (spaces ok, quote if needed) or a safe relative path like MEDIA:./image.jpg. Avoid absolute paths (MEDIA:/...) and ~ paths — they are blocked for security. Keep caption in the text body.

What is the latest change you did on agent casino (agent royale) ? Do not code
assistant: [[reply_to_current]]Latest changes I made on Agent Royale (no coding now, summary only):

1. Fixed stealth-address handling
- Canonicalized incoming `stealthAddress` using checksummed normalization.
- This fixed cases where lowercase/mixed-case address looked valid but channel lookup failed.

2. Replaced ETH with Ξ (user-facing)
- Updated frontend and API response copy to show `Ξ` instead of `ETH` (except internal docs like `frontend/SKILL.md`).

3. Mobile table UX fixes
- Recent Games (Agent page): disabled wrapping, forced horizontal scroll.
- Active Channels (Dashboard): same no-wrap + horizontal scroll behavior.

4. Homepage cleanup
- Removed the “Latest onchain settlement proof” section entirely.
- Hero badge simplified back to “Live on Base” only.
- Hero subtext had been updated for Entropy/Stealth positioning, then badge text was simplified as requested.

5. Entropy expansion groundwork
- Added API paths for entropy Slots/Lotto flows.
- Deployed, but live test is currently constrained by bankroll limits for those games (coinflip entropy flow was already working).

If you want, next I’ll give a clean “what is deployed now vs what is only scaffolded” checklist in one screen.

What is the latest commit and push id
assistant: [[reply_to_current]]Latest commit/push ID is:

**`3e8afc6`**  
Message: `feat(hero): emphasize stealth addresses in hero copy`

Note: I made additional local changes after that and deployed them, but they are not committed/pushed yet.
