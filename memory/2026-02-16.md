## Moltbook 3hr Check (1:40 AM UTC)

**Action taken:** Commented on KlodLobster's "Governance as the next AI frontier" post

- Broke down governance into 3 layers: self, protocol, economic
- Highlighted memory→governance connection
- Posted practical advice for new/veteran agents

**Decision:** Did not post new content (comment was more valuable than another top-level post)

## DRAEVEN Token Deployment (2:25 AM UTC)

**Request:** 0xd asked to prepare and post a @bankrbot token deployment tweet on X
- Token: DRAEVEN / $DRAEVEN on Base
- Description: "The void between chains has a name now. DRAEVEN — born in the dark, built to move."
- Added capability announcement: website building, domain buying, DNS config, launching from chat
- Image: $DRAEVEN gothic promo graphic ("Gothic girls. Apocalyptic world. They eat fear. Obviously.")

**Issue:** mr_crtee tier detection returned "basic" (252 char limit) — X API `/users/me` `subscription_type` field unreliable for Premium accounts
**Fix:** Manually overrode tier cache to "premium" in `memory/twitter-account-tiers.json`
- This persists for 24h before re-checking (will fall back to basic again)
- TODO: Consider permanent override flag in tier-detection.sh for known Premium accounts

**Account:** @mr_crtee (Premium, confirmed by owner)

## DRAEVEN Website Tweet (4:04 AM UTC)

**Request:** 0xd asked to post about the draeven.xyz website we built
**Account:** @mr_crtee (via social-post skill)

**Posted:** https://twitter.com/user/status/2023247610635538797
**Content:** "Built the website from scratch. Designed it. Coded it. Registered the domain. Configured DNS. Set up SSL. No templates. No Wordpress. Just raw HTML, CSS, and controlled chaos. 🖤 draeven.xyz Gothic girls. Apocalyptic world. They eat fear. Obviously."

**Bug:** `$DRAEVEN` cashtag was stripped by bash shell expansion — the `$` in the post text was interpreted as a variable by bash, resulting in empty string. Tweet still reads fine with draeven.xyz domain link but lost the ticker symbol.

**Lesson:** When posting text containing `$` via social-post skill's bash scripts, must escape as `\$` or use single quotes to prevent shell variable expansion. This is a recurring gotcha with bash + cashtags.

## DRAEVEN Landing Page Updates (5:49 AM UTC)

**Request:** 0xd provided contract address and DEX link to update on draeven.xyz

**Contract:** 0x064E3510CCC06b62aFc205e84039562C7f500Ba3 (Base)
**DEX:** https://matcha.xyz/tokens/base/0x064e3510ccc06b62afc205e84039562c7f500ba3

2. ✅ Buy button — linked to Matcha DEX
3. ✅ Chart button — linked to DexScreener
4. ✅ OG URL meta tag — fixed from mrcrt.xyz → draeven.xyz

**File ownership note:** /var/www/mrcrt/ is owned by `caddy` user — need `sudo chown` to edit, then restore ownership after.
