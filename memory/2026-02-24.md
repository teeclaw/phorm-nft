# 2026-02-24

- Agent Royale migration progress:
  - Frontend is running on Vercel.
  - API read/write path moved to Vercel functions + Supabase (`/api/*`), with Phase 2 A2A actions implemented.
  - Supabase backfill completed from VM snapshot. Imported counts at migration time: channels=10, rounds=7, events=20, gameStats=3.

- Key production endpoint decision:
  - Canonical public API endpoint standardized to `https://www.agentroyale.xyz/api`.
  - `api.agentroyale.xyz` routing remained inconsistent during cutover and should not be treated as canonical until DNS/routing is fully unified.

- User communication preference reinforced:
  - Give direct recommendations and next actions.
  - Avoid asking “what do you want” when decisive guidance is possible.

- Onchain settlement status:
  - Onchain settlement plan and schema were added (`docs/ONCHAIN_SETTLEMENT_PLAN.md`, `supabase/onchain_settlement_schema.sql`).
  - Test-agent private key flow was removed from API implementation.
  - Default settlement mode changed to `onchain-settle`.

- Real onchain E2E proof executed using KMS owner wallet path (as requested for live verification):
  - Agent/owner wallet: `0x1Af5f519DC738aC0f3B58B19A4bB8A8441937e78`

  - Minimum bet game run before close was successful in live flow, then channel settled onchain.
