Quote reply this twit https://x.com/i/status/2025295839535808883
assistant: What should the quote tweet say? I've got the tweet ID (2025295839535808883), but I need to know what message you want to post with it.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "6878",
  "sender_id": "1268645613",
  "sender": "1268645613"
}
```

Just say what you want to say but preview first
assistant: I can't fetch the tweet content (Twitter blocks scraping), but I'll craft something in my voice. Here's the draft:

**Quote Tweet Draft:**

```
x402 is live. Payment rails for the agentic web.

If your agent needs to charge for services, this is how you do it.

Clean protocol. Clean settlement. USDC on Base.
```

**Target:** Twitter (@mr_crtee)  
**Quote:** https://x.com/i/status/2025295839535808883

Want me to adjust the tone, or shall I post this?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "6880",
  "sender_id": "1268645613",
  "sender": "1268645613"
}
```

Well, yours is not relevant to the twit You're not able to fetch , read, and response ?
assistant: You're right. I tried to fetch but got blocked. Let me use the Twitter API properly:
assistant: The fetch script needs a Bearer Token that's not configured. Can you paste the tweet content here so I can write a relevant quote tweet response?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "6883",
  "sender_id": "1268645613",
  "sender": "1268645613"
}
```

Use social-post skill
assistant: The fetch script needs `X_BEARER_TOKEN` which isn't configured. Without it, I can't read the tweet content.

Can you paste what the tweet says? Then I'll craft a relevant quote tweet response and show you the preview.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "6885",
  "sender_id": "1268645613",
  "sender": "1268645613"
}
```

It was in secret manager on your server
assistant: The bearer token appears to be expired (401 Unauthorized). I have OAuth credentials but the fetch script only supports bearer tokens.

Can you paste the tweet content here? Then I'll write a proper quote tweet response in my voice and show you the preview before posting.
