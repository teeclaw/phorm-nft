## Conversation Summary

assistant: Processing... let me keep polling.
assistant: ✅ Bankr is live. Here's your setup:

**🔑 Wallets:**
- EVM: `0x2f77387a1d97ea6cf3ecb3a86ec95d21c90163f0`
- Solana: `7DnAbjcnkEB55mbjZfztj1t6ryGe51DBMSmCcsqzqSwj`

**💰 Portfolio ($1.92 total):**
- Base: 0.00058 ETH ($1.32) + some tokens
- Solana: 0.005 SOL ($0.53)
- **Ethereum mainnet: 0 ETH** ⚠️

So for the ERC-8004 registration:
- **Mainnet** → you'll need to fund your Ethereum wallet with some ETH first (~$10-20 for gas)
- **Sepolia testnet** → free, we can test right now with no funding needed

Which do you want to go with? And while you decide, still need those registration details (agent name, description, etc.) 📺

[Telegram 0x•das.eth (@Oxdasx) id:1268645613 +11m 2026-02-03 11:10 UTC] But i must also provide sepolia ?
[message_id: 334]
assistant: Nah, no need to buy anything. Sepolia is a testnet — you get free ETH from a **faucet**. Here's how:

1. Copy your EVM wallet address: `0x2f77387a1d97ea6cf3ecb3a86ec95d21c90163f0`
2. Go to a faucet like **[sepoliafaucet.com](https://sepoliafaucet.com)** or **[faucet.google.com](https://faucet.google.com)**
3. Paste your address → get free Sepolia ETH
4. Done ✅

Once you've got some, just say the word and we'll kick off the registration. Still need those details though 😄

- **Agent name**
- **Description**
- Anything else (image, website, ENS) → optional
user: [Telegram 0x•das.eth (@Oxdasx) id:1268645613 +42s 2026-02-03 11:11 UTC] By registering i will receive ENS also ?
[message_id: 336]
assistant: Nope — ERC-8004 and ENS are separate things. Here's the difference:

- **ERC-8004** → gives your agent an **NFT identity** on-chain (agent ID, reputation, discoverability)
- **ENS** → gives you a **human-readable name** like `youragent.eth`

What you *can* do is **link** an ENS name to your ERC-8004 agent after registration — it's one of the optional service fields. But you'd need to already own an ENS name.

We actually installed the **ens-primary-name** skill earlier — that can help you set one up if you want. But that's a separate step.

For now, want to just roll with the ERC-8004 registration first? 📺
user: [Tue 2026-02-03 12:32 UTC] But, i cannot retrieve private key from given wallet ?
[message_id: 1ac363b7-ccc4-4166-b22c-585ee222c4fc]
assistant: Right, and you don't need to. Here's how it works:

- **Bankr wallet is custodial** — the private key is managed by Bankr's infrastructure, not exposed to you. That's by design for security.
- **But you don't need it** for ERC-8004 registration. The `register-onchain.sh` script submits the transaction **through Bankr's API** — Bankr signs it on your behalf behind the scenes.

So the flow is:
1. We build the registration data URI ✅
2. Script encodes the calldata ✅
3. Script tells Bankr: *"submit this tx on Sepolia/Ethereum"* ✅
4. Bankr signs + broadcasts it using your wallet ✅

No private key needed on your end. Ready to fill in those registration details and kick it off? 📺
user: [Tue 2026-02-03 12:33 UTC] I now it don't need PK , but i want to control given wallet by adding in to my Wallet app
[message_id: 43a9801e-9992-42e2-a02e-bdb3aa417ba8]
assistant: Ah got it — you want to **export the private key** from Bankr so you can import it into MetaMask / Trust Wallet / etc.

That's a Bankr account setting, not something I can pull from here. Try this:

1. Go to **[bankr.bot](https://bankr.bot)** → log in
2. Look for **Wallet settings** or **Export private key** option in your account/dashboard
3. Copy the key and import it into your wallet app

If you can't find it there, check their docs or support. Want me to look it up for you? 📺
user: [Tue 2026-02-03 12:36 UTC] once it registered , am i able to modfy the metadata ?
[message_id: 1488bff9-543f-4bdc-8a77-6baef8879a24]
assistant: Yeah, fully modifiable. Two ways to do it:

1. **Update the whole profile** — `setAgentURI(agentId, newURI)` replaces the entire registration. We have a script for this: `update-profile.sh`
2. **Tweak individual fields** — `setMetadata(agentId, key, value)` lets you change specific bits without touching the rest

So register first, tweak later — no pressure to get everything perfect on day one. 📺

Ready to fill in those details and get it rolling?
user: [Tue 2026-02-03 12:44 UTC] Proceed the registration Agent name — "Mr. Tee" Description — "autonomous AI agent that analyzes patterns, reasons deeply, and executes actions as an assistant to @0xdasx—adjusts antenna—always finding signal in the noise." Mainnet or Sepolia testnet? Mainnet
[message_id: 55b944ac-7204-4189-8fac-7b0e341d4a46]
assistant: Hold up 0xd — your **Ethereum mainnet wallet has 0 ETH**. The data URI registration will cost ~$5–20 in gas. It'll fail without funds.

You need to **bridge or send some ETH to your Bankr wallet first:**

`0x2f77387a1d97ea6cf3ecb3a86ec95d21c90163f0`

You have 0.00058 ETH on **Base** — not enough. Options:

1. **Fund from an external wallet** — send ~0.02 ETH to the address above on Ethereum mainnet
2. **Bridge from Base** — we can use the `bridge-to-mainnet.sh` script, but you'd need more ETH on Base first
3. **Switch to Sepolia testnet** — free, we can test right now with a faucet

What do you want to do? 📺
