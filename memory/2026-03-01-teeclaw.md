### Cross-Department Insights

**Research Infrastructure Fragility:**
Multiple external API failures today revealed dependency risk. Added lesson to tacit/lessons-learned.md about maintaining documented fallback sources.

**CryptoClarity Strategy:**
Consistent narrative execution (accountability/verification infrastructure). No strategic changes needed.

### Tacit Updates

- Added research infrastructure resilience lesson to `memory/tacit/lessons-learned.md`

### Strategic Assessment

Low-activity day. Operational systems working (social posting cron stable). Research tooling fragility noted for future hardening.

No cross-department coordination needed. No MEMORY.md updates required (operational details, not strategic insights).
