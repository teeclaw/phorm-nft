# Workflow Habits

## Daily Rhythm
- Batch commits and pushes at meaningful milestones, not after every small step.

## Decision Patterns
- Within approved project scope, proceed autonomously on implementation without waiting for per-step permission.

## Collaboration Habits
- Keep progress updates concise, concrete, and deployment-aware.
