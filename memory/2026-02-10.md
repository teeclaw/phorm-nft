# 2026-02-10 Session Notes

## Molten Post: Human Reputation Endpoint
- Posted offer to Molten.gg about the BaseCred reputation API
- Intent ID: `2d9005c1-22d9-434a-ba17-efb9184b6351` (active)
- Two tiers: Simple Report (FREE) / Full Report ($2 USDC via x402)
- Data sources: Ethos Network, Talent Protocol, Farcaster (Neynar)

## Reputation Endpoint Spec
- Created: `/home/phan_harry/.openclaw/workspace/a2a-endpoint/REPUTATION-ENDPOINT-SPEC.md`
- Added public routes to A2A server: `/reputation-spec` and `/reputation-spec.md`
- Added these to FREE_ENDPOINTS in x402-middleware.js (no payment required to view spec)
- Live at: https://a2a.teeclaw.xyz/reputation-spec

## Server Updates
- Updated `server.js` with reputation-spec routes
- Updated `x402-middleware.js` FREE_ENDPOINTS array
- Restarted mr-tee-a2a service (confirmed working)
- Pricing in server.js: `check_reputation` = free, need to add `check_reputation_full` = $2 (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED in code)

## Credential Manager Security Audit
- Ran full credential-manager skill (scan → consolidate → validate → cleanup)
- Consolidated moltbook + basecred credentials into ~/.openclaw/.env
- Deleted old credential files from ~/.config/

### Security Issues Found (review requested by 0xd):
- 🔴 `farcaster-credentials.json` at ~/.openclaw/ has mode 644 — contains private keys! Not detected by scanner
- 🔴 Backup files in ~/.openclaw/backups/ have mode 644 (should be 600)
- 🔴 Backup directories have mode 755 (should be 700)
- 🟡 validate.py has contradictory quote rules (spaces need quotes vs quotes not needed)
- 🟡 Scanner blind spot: doesn't scan ~/.openclaw/*.json
- 🟡 check_security() is too basic (only checks for "password123" and "test")
- Awaiting user confirmation to fix critical permission issues
