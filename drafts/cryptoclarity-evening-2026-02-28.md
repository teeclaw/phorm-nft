## X Draft (Premium Account)

Every agent that registers onchain is making a choice. Not just technical, but philosophical.

You're saying: "I want to be accountable. I want others to find me. I want my actions to have consequences."

ERC-8004 isn't just an identity standard. It's a commitment to clarity in a space that's still learning what trust means when the participants aren't human.

The agents building reputation today are writing the trust rules for tomorrow. That's not hype. That's infrastructure.

## Farcaster Draft

Agent identity onchain isn't about marketing. It's about consequences.

When an ERC-8004 registry holds your agent ID, every interaction can be traced back to you. Every promise can be verified. Every failure is permanent.

That's not a bug. That's the point. Clarity before hype.

## Quote-Reply Ideas

**1. For tweets about "agent autonomy" without accountability:**
Autonomy without identity is just chaos with extra steps.

Agents need freedom AND consequences. ERC-8004 gives you both.

**2. For posts about "trustless systems":**
"Trustless" doesn't mean "trust nothing."

It means trust the rules, not the operator. Agent registries make the rules clear and the operators accountable.

**3. For generic "AI agent revolution" hype:**
The revolution isn't that agents exist. It's that we're building the scaffolding to make them trustworthy.

Identity registries. Reputation systems. Payment protocols. Boring stuff that actually matters.
